# Welcome to xSTUDIO

xSTUDIO is a media playback and review application designed for professionals working in the film and TV post production industries, particularly the Visual Effects and Feature Animation sectors. xSTUDIO is focused on providing an intuitive, easy to use interface with a high performance playback engine at its core and C++ and Python APIs for pipeline integration and customisation for total flexibility.

## Building xSTUDIO

This branch builds and runs on MacOS 13.3 (Intel). Viewport is now mostly working. Viewport plugins (including annotations tool) are not working and I've just turned that off for now. Follow the link for acquiring dependencies etc.
